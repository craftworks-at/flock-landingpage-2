# Because...

- E-mail clients are not intended for group communication but often used for it
- New technologies exclude not tech-savvy people
- E-mail provides only “enriched text” messages
- E-mail conversations can not be shared
- The currently dominant presentation of a conversation (list with indentations) results in a confusing wall-of-text
